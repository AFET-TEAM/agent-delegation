# Commit Standards Skill

## Scope

This skill defines the commit message format and conventions for all agents that produce code.
Every commit must follow these standards — non-compliant commits are rejected.

## Commit Types

| Type         | Usage                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`       | New feature added                                             |
| `feat!`      | Breaking change (Conventional Commits standard `!` suffix)    |
| `fix`        | Bug fix (include repro steps, expected vs actual)             |
| `add`        | Non-feature addition to existing code (project extension)     |
| `refactor`   | Code restructuring without behavior change                    |
| `redesign`   | UI/UX revision                                                |
| `style`      | Minor formatting/punctuation changes (no logic change)        |
| `chore`      | Dependency updates or non-critical maintenance                |
| `docs`       | Documentation changes                                         |
| `test`       | Adding or modifying tests                                     |

## Commit Message Format

### Structure

```

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### 1. Subject Line (Header)

- Start with lowercase after the colon.
- Maximum **50 characters**.
- Use imperative mood.
- Do NOT end with a period.
- Include the file path as scope.

```
feat(Home/index.tsx): Banner module development
fix(Login/index.tsx): Fix incorrect counter value
add(Home/index.tsx): Add new utility function
refactor(UserService/index.ts): Restructure validation logic
```

### 2. Body (Description)

- Provide detailed explanation of **why** and **how**.
- Leave one blank line between subject and body.
- Use bullet points for multiple changes.

```
feat(Home/index.tsx): Banner module development

- Banner module developed and integrated into homepage.
- Responsive design applied for mobile devices.
- Related documentation updated.
```

### 3. Footer

- Include ticket or PR references.

```
feat(Home/index.tsx): Banner module development

- Banner module developed and integrated into homepage.
- Responsive design applied for mobile devices.

Refs: #1234
```

### 4. Single-Line Format (for small changes)

When subject, body, and footer can be combined:

```
fix(Home/index.tsx): Fix click counter returning wrong value #0001
```

---

## Scope Convention

The scope should reference the **file path** relative to the source root to validate which files were changed.

```
feat(Home/index.tsx)      — New feature in Home component
fix(Login/index.tsx)       — Bug fix in Login component
refactor(UserService.ts)   — Refactoring service layer
style(Header/style.scss)   — Style-only changes
test(User.spec.ts)         — Test changes
```

---

## Rules

1. **One logical change per commit** — do not mix features, fixes, and refactors.
2. **Atomic commits** — each commit should be independently buildable.
3. **Language**: Commit messages are in **English** (Conventional Commits format).
4. **No WIP commits** — squash or amend before pushing.
5. **Reference tickets** in footer when applicable.
6. **Do NOT commit** generated files, `node_modules`, `dist`, or build artifacts.

## Examples

### Feature Commit

```
feat(Dashboard/index.tsx): Add real-time notification widget

- Integrated WebSocket connection for live updates.
- Added notification badge with unread count.
- Implemented auto-dismiss after 5 seconds.

Refs: #456
```

### Bug Fix Commit

```
fix(Auth/login-form.tsx): Fix form submission on Enter key

- Form was not submitting when user pressed Enter.
- Added onKeyDown handler to trigger form submission.
- Added unit test for keyboard interaction.

Refs: #789
```

### Refactor Commit

```
refactor(UserService.ts): Extract validation into separate module

- Moved validation logic to user-validation.ts.
- Reduced UserService from 280 to 150 lines.
- No behavior change — all existing tests pass.
```
